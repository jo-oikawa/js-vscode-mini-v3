# VS Code‑ish Example Project

This is a minimal starter project bundled with the demo so the Explorer and tabs
always have content on first load. You can replace these files with your own by
using:

- “Project: Load Example (assets/default)” to reload this starter
- “Project: Open Folder…” to pick a local folder (Chromium/Edge/Chrome on localhost/https)

```js
// app.js
console.log('Hello from the example project!');
```

Happy hacking!
